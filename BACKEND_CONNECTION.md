## 🧪 **API Connection Test**

I've added an **API Tester Component** to your home page that will:

1. **Test Categories API** - Verify categories are loading
2. **Test Artworks API** - Verify artworks endpoint responds
3. **Test Featured Artworks** - Check featured artworks endpoint
4. **Show Response Times** - Monitor API performance
5. **Display Sample Data** - Show what data is being received

### To Test Your Connection:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click **"Test Backend Connection"** button
4. View results to confirm all APIs are working

## 🎨 **Category Data Structure**

Your backend returns this format (which is now supported):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "cat_7cbba02b4b74",
      "name": "Abstract",
      "description": "Abstract art pieces with vibrant colors and forms",
      "color": "#6366f1",
      "isActive": true,
      "sortOrder": 1,
      "createdAt": "2025-06-28T14:14:58.572Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Your Live Categories:

1. **Abstract** (#6366f1) - Abstract art pieces with vibrant colors and forms
2. **Landscape** (#10b981) - Nature and landscape art capturing natural beauty
3. **Portrait** (#f59e0b) - Portrait artwork showcasing human expression
4. **Urban** (#8b5cf6) - Modern urban and city-inspired artworks

## 📝 **Remove API Tester (After Testing)**

Once you've confirmed everything works, remove this line from `src/app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Remove this section after testing
<div className="bg-slate-900 pt-20 pb-8">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
    <ApiTester />
  </div>
</div>
```
